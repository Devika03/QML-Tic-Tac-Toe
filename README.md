This is an enhanced version of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, incorporating elements of quantum mechanics, such as quantum gates, superposition, entanglement, etc., to add depth and complexity to the strategic gameplay.

Here, we have demonstrated the game rules, my fair play mechanisms, as well as its measurement and collapse processes. I also provided examples of movement operations, mainly focusing on the quantum aspects, such as entanglement and its associated risk levels.
